## Alarm sensor node, with RTOS → ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-under%20development-8A2BE2)
#### Overview
This is a modular component of a larger IoT system (Smart Hub) consisting of multiple nodes.

This repository manages sensor data for an alarm system running on an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi. The system is designed to be deterministic with non-blocking functions for maximum reliability.

#### Architecture - Interrupts & RTOS

The system utilizes Hardware Interrupts for immediate sensor detection and FreeRTOS for task orchestration and Binary Semaphores.
* Priority 3 (High): Critical alarm events (PIR/Reed/MQ2/DS18B20) via hardware interrupts & semaphores.
* Priority 2 (Medium): System monitoring (Temp/Water leak).
* Priority 1 (Low): Network communication (WiFi/MQTT/BLE).
* Software Timer: Used for a real-time LED status indication, without the memory cost of a dedicated task.

#### Setup - Info

1) Update your WIFI: SSID + Password → plattformio.ini
2) Update your Broker/Zero IP adress → mqtt_client.cpp

**Visual Diagnostic (LED matrix)**
* Flash patterns:
  * System ready: Slow blink
  * Not connected to WiFi, MQTT or BLE: Fast blink

* LED states: 
  * Idle → 2x2 center LEDs
  * Alarming → ALL matrix LEDs

#### Upcomming

* Implement & integrate other sensors (MQ2, PIR, Water-leak)
* RTOS: Queue, for alarms.
* BLE: Sending alarm "struct" when trigged

#### Hardware
* MCU: Arduino Uno R4 WiFi

| DHT11         | Indoor: temp + humidity       | D2 (P104)     |  Broker @ MQTT   | Yes          |                     |
| DS18B20       | Temp, fire  (pull-up needed)  | D5 (P107)     | Broker @ MQTT    | Yes          |                     |
| MQ2           | Gas, fire                     |  -            | *(Broker @ MQTT)*  |              | Yes                 |
| Rain-sensor   | Water leak                    |  -            | *(Broker @ MQTT)*  |              |                     |
| PIR           | Motion                        | D4 (P106)     | *(ESP32 @ BLE)*    |              | Yes                 |
| Reed          | Open door or window           | D3 (P105)     | *(ESP32 @ BLE)*    | Yes          | Yes                 |


#### Mode Info

* *BLE*
  * BLE "dummy" messages are now sent every 5s (counter)

* *MQTT*
  * MQTT is sent every 30s
  * Sending sensor values & Online/Offline status (LWT & heartbeat) 

* *RTC (Time stamp)*
  * The clock is synchronized via WiFi on startup
  * Every alarm event has an time stamp
