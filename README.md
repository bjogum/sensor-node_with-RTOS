# Alarm sensor node, with RTOS → ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-under%20development-8A2BE2)

This is a the sensor-node part, of the **Home Hub** project.

This repository manages all sensor data, running on an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi. The system is designed to be deterministic with non-blocking functions for maximum reliability. The communication to the Broker (RBP Zero) & the Gateway (ESP32) occurs via BLE and WIFI (MQTT).

## Architecture - RTOS & Tasks

The system utilizes Hardware Interrupts for immediate sensor detection and FreeRTOS for task orchestration and Binary Semaphores.
* Priority 3 (High): Critical alarm events (PIR/Reed/MQ2/DS18B20) via hardware interrupts & semaphores.
* Priority 2 (Medium): Network communication (WiFi/MQTT/BLE).
* Priority 1 (Low): System monitoring (Temp/Water leak).
* Software Timer: Used for a real-time LED status indication, without the memory cost of a dedicated task.

## Alarm-procedure

When an alarm is detected - at fire or intrution:
1) The system notice the alarm, and update the state machine
2) The alarm info is stored in a packed struct of 5 bytes, "AlarmInfo"
   1) Timestamp is added (unix time)
   2) Alarmtype is added (what kind of alarm)
3) The alarm info is sending three times to a queue (AlarmQueue)
4) The xNetworkTask wake up at queue - and send the alarm to BLE.

## Comminucation: BLE & MQTT 

BLE (Tx) - `Indicate with handshake`:
  * Heartbet: Every 5s 
  * Send critical alarms, as packages.

MQTT (Tx):
* Heartbet: Every 10s
* Has Will & Testament (LWT)
  * If the sensor node stops sending heartbeats, an 'OFFLINE' status will be published by the Broker.
* Send info every 30s: temp/humidity & ( soon water leak )

---
## Upcomming

* Implement & integrate other sensors (MQ2, PIR, Water-leak)
* BLE (Rx) - Receive and handle alarm state from ESP32 (GW)
* Add time-zone (ezTime ?)

## More info ####

* *RTC (Time stamp)*
  * The clock is synchronized via WiFi on startup
  * Every alarm event has an time stamp

## Setup - Info

1) Update your WIFI: SSID + Password → plattformio.ini
2) Update your Broker/Zero IP adress → mqtt_client.cpp

**Visual Diagnostic (LED matrix)**
* Flash patterns:
  * System ready: Slow blink
  * Not connected to WiFi, MQTT or BLE: Fast blink

* LED states: 
  * Idle → 2x2 center LEDs
  * Alarming → ALL matrix LEDs
